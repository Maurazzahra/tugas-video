                    <p>The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). </p>

                <div class="col tiga">tiga
                    <p>Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based).</p>

                    <p>Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.</p>
